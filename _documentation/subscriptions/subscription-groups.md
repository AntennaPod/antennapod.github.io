# Assigning groups / tags / categories to subscription

To manage subscriptions it is possible to assign groups / tags / categories to a subscription.
Please note that for the moment it is not possible to create queue(s) based on it. To do so it would first be needed to support multiple queues. (See related [issue 2648](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/2648))

To assign groups / tags / categoriers to a podcasdt you have to :
- go to podcast / subscription screen
- tap on gear icon to podcast access specific settings
- tap on group entry
