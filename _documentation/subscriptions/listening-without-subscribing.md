# Listening to an episode without subscribing

Currently there is no way to add an episode to queue without subscribing.
You can follow [issue 4710](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/4710) for more information or to be kept updated.

Still there is a way to preview an episode without having to subscribe. Main differences with adding an episode to queue without subscribing are :
- episode automatically start playing (making it the current episode)
- it's not possible to switch to another episode and come back to it later

To preview an episode : 
- do as if you were adding a subscription
- don't tap on subscribe but on the episode you want to listen
- episode description will expand, below description tap on preview
