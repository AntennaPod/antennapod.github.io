# Listening to an episode without subscribing

Currently there is no way to add an episode to the queue without subscribing.
You can find more information in the [feature request on our development platform](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/4710).

There  is, however, a way to **preview** an episode without having to subscribe to the podcast. The main differences with adding an episode to the queue without subscribing are:
- The episode automatically starts playing (making it the current episode)
- It's not possible to switch to another episode and come back to it later

To preview an episode: 
- Do as if you were adding a subscription
- Don't tap on subscribe but on the episode you want to listen
- The episode description will expand; tap on `Preview` below description
