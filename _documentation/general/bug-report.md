# I found a bug!
That is sad to hear. Please let us know by creating a post on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/). Please make sure to use the search function first, so the same bug is not reported multiple times. Please include the system information that is displayed in `Settings` » `Report bug`.

# You made a spelling mistake
Translations are provided by the community. If you found a typo or would like to suggest a better translation, you can change the texts yourself on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/antennapod/antennapod/). While changing it yourself is the fastest method, you can also just write a post in the translators section of our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/).
