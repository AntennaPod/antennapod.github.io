# Using external storage

You can set AntennaPod to download episodes to your sd card instead of the internal memory. This ensures that you have more space for episodes. To select the storage card, go to `Settings` » `Storage` » `Data folder`.

## Troubleshooting

It might be possible that your SD card does not show up in the `Choose Data Folder` dialog. For your SD card to show up, Android must recognize the card as external storage. Either the card is not mounted correctly or the manufacturer or your smartphone configured the hardware incorrectly.

If you are running Android 6+ (Marshmallow or newer), you can try [formatting](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=android+6+sd+card+internal+storage) the SD card as internal storage. Else, there is nothing we can do to fix this.
