# Create an 'Open in AntennaPod' link

Do you want to make it easy for your network or audience to add your podcast(s) in AntennaPod?

Simply include a link to `https://antennapod.org/deeplink/subscribe/?url=xyz` on your website or wherever you want. Make sure to replace `xyz` with the URL of your RSS feed.

Users who have installed AntennaPod version 2.4.0 or higher will directly see your podcast (and be able to preview or add it). Users who don't have this recent version will see our website with a nice 'Subscribe' button which will open your podcast in AntennaPod.

If you need our logo, please have a look at our [branding repository](https://github.com/AntennaPod/branding).
