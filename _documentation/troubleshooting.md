# Connectivity problems : podcast not updating or episodes not downloading
Check if podcast link is working in your web browser. You can get the link used by AntennaPod in podcast screen, information icon and then tap on the podcast link to copy it.

If the problem is with episode, try to download one with your web browser. Open link like previously described. Try to find download link to copy it and paste it in URL bar to trigger episode download. You can search for "enclosure url" or "mp3" or "type=" to help locating link.

If it is not working with web browser then look on your device if there is not something interfering with network connection :
- ad blockers like Blockada
- firewall
- VPN
- DNS provider

If it is with web browser but not with AntennaPod ask for help in [AntennaPod Forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/)
