    <p>
      AntennaPod is developed and maintained by individual volunteers and not represented by any legal entity. The community doesn't need your data, so the app and website are designed to be fully GDPR compliant. Read on to learn more.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What kind of data we store</h2>
    <p>
      The AntennaPod app only stores data strictly necessary to for the app to function, as provided by you, the user. This includes for example the list of podcasts you follow, the app settings, and authentication data provided for specific podcasts or services (such as Gpodder). The app does not include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code, such as Google Analytics.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The AntennaPod website, hosted via GitHub Pages, does not store any cookies on your machine, and no 3rd party tracking (analytics) or other services are used.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How AntennaPod processes your data</h2>
    <p>
      <b>All data provided using the AntennaPod app is stored locally on your device.</b> AntennaPod does not upload your data anywhere, except where strictly necessary for the functioning of the app. The cases where specific bits of information are sent to 3rd parties include, but may not be limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>certain podcast providers, when provided in the feed settings: authentication data</li>
      <li>synchronisation service (gpodder.net), when enabled in the app settings: login credentials and all your subscriptions and playback events requested by the service (see the <a href="https://gpodder.net/privacy/">gpodder.net Privacy Policy</a> how gpodder.net handles your data)</li>
      <li>podcast discovery services (fyyd, iTunes, gpodder.net), when using the podcast search feature: search keywords, and in some cases the app name ("AntennaPod")</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The developers of AntennaPod do not have access to any of your information, except when you actively share debugging information (either via email using the 'Crash Report' function, or via the Android crash reporting functionality of Google).
    </p>

    <h2>What data other parties might collect, store and process</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Google</b>: If you have activated <em>backup &amp; reset</em> in your phone settings (<em>Settings</em> → <em>Backup & Reset</em> → <em>Back up my data</em>), you should be aware that Android itself will periodically save a copy of your phone's data in Google's servers. This backup contains private information, including your WiFi passwords, messages and call history. It may also include data from AntennaPod and from other apps you use. The developers of AntennaPod do not have access to this data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Podcast hosters</b>: The web servers that provide the podcast feeds might collect additional data, such as your IP address, access time and what is being accessed. This includes the episodes you are downloading or streaming. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details. You can view the URL of a podcast by opening the podcast and pressing the info icon. AntennaPod does not allow remote servers to set cookies. The servers can detect the fact that you are using AntennaPod and which version of AntennaPod you are using (HTTP <em>User-Agent</em>). If multiple podcasts are hosted on the same server, the server can detect the list of podcasts that you subscribed to and that are hosted on that server. This might happen if publishers use feedburner, podtrac or similar services to distribute their feeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Search services</b>: When using the search feature of iTunes, fyyd or gpodder.net, those services can store your query. After subscribing, the feed is usually served from the creator's server.
    </p>
    
  <h2>Permissions</h2>

    <p>
      The app requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Read from/write to Storage (Photos/Media/Files)</strong><br />
        The storage permission is used to open files that are not downloaded directly from within the app. It can also be used to import app settings or OPML files. The permission is only requested if you perform an action that requires reading from storage.</li>
        <li><strong>View WiFi connections</strong><br />
        AntennaPod allows to restrict automatic updates to specific WiFi networks.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
  <h2>Updates of this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The developers may update this policy in the future. It is advisable to check the policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are made on this document.
