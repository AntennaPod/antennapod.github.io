Our old website was basically just a single page, which looked okay but it was not too useful. Its FAQ section was outdated and did not follow the design of the rest of the page. Additionally, the FAQ page was linked nowhere -- if you did not know where to look, you did not find it. Links to platforms for contribution ([GitHub](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/) for development, [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/antennapod/antennapod/) for translations and the [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/)) were hidden in a small footer menu. The website highlighted a few features but it did not describe how to use them. Additionally, the website was a plain html file, making it rather hard to update. You can find the old website on the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200814004524/https://antennapod.org/).

After noticing the awesome redesign of the website of [K9-Mail](https://k9mail.app/) (open-source email app), I reached out to the designer of that website, [Anxhelo Lushka](https://github.com/AnXh3L0), asking if we can copy the K9-Mail website for AntennaPod. Anxhelo then offered to create a brand new website, specifically for AntennaPod! You are currently looking at our new website. It has more features, like a [documentation section](/documentation) and a [blog](/blog). Thank you very much to the awesome designer Anxhelo!
