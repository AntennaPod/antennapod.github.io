Whether you're subscribed to a lot of podcasts or just a handful, you want to know what's the next thing you can listen to/what to play next. Version 2.7 of AntennaPod introduces a better way to do just that: the Inbox!

# Introducting the Inbox
The Inbox displays all new episodes. As soon as you interact with an episode anywhere in the app (start playback, download, etc) - it automatically gets removed from the Inbox. At that point, after all, you've seen it exists and made a decision on what to do with it.

With swipe actions in the inbox, which you are invited to set up on first use, you can:
* Add episodes to the Queue
* Remove episodes from the Inbox
(similar to removing the 'new' label in previous versions)
* Download episodes

True podcast addicts might use the Inbox as a 'triage' screen, manually curating episodes and swiping the best ones straight into the queue. Those who follow just 2 or 3 podcasts might check this overview of new episodes when they're up to listening to something, and start playing an episode that looks interesting.

If you're an existing user, you'll notice that your inbox will be full. That's because all episodes that had the 'new' label are now in your inbox. Whether you ignore the list, slowly work your way through it, or 'remove all from inbox' is up to you.

# Not all that special
Now you wonder - what's so special about an inbox? Don't we already know this concept since the nineties from e-mail?

Truth be told: yes. But none of the other major podcast apps seem to have this. This functionality has been developed after a [request](https://forum.antennapod.org/t/introduce-new-screen-sytem-inbox/723) from one of our active contributors (the author of this post, as it happens), rather than by copying the other apps.

And we have to admint: even for AntennaPod it's not that revolutionary. Our long-time users probably already know the 'New' tab of the Episodes screen. The downside of the old Episodes screen was that the presence of tabs prevented the introduction of swipe actions. With that switched around managing new episodes is a whole lot easier.

# What's next
So far we've had positive feedback from our beta testers. (You can [join the beta testing](/documentation/general/beta) if you want.) But there already are ideas for further improvements. For example:
* Allow to swipe episodes from the inbox directly into an 'ignored' status. These episodes then won't be auto-downloaded. Podcast junkies can build statistics about which podcasts they might want to un-suscribe from.
* Introduce a 'Skip inbox' setting at podcast-level. Because the podcast is so great that you've already activated notifications for it, or don't need to triage them. Or because a podcast has only very few gems, and your friends will tell you about them.
* (Re-)Introduce a NEW label for podcasts that were released recently. So that you can see what's been released since you last opened AntennaPod.
* Add a dating-app-like swipe experience. Because the list view doesn't provide much information, while a full-screen swipe experience allows to show (part of) the description text.

How will you use the Inbox? What further tweaks would you like to see? Don't hesitate to chip in on our forum to [share your thoughts](https://forum.antennapod.org)!
