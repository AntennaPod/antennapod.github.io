We‚Äôve all been there: a podcast you loved and spent many hours listening to is finally over. Understandably, you might be tempted to just remove it and move on. After all, who doesn‚Äôt want to keep their subscription list neat, tidy and quick to refresh?

However, it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way (unless you want it, of course): AntennaPod allows you to keep track of your past listens while still keeping things organised and efficient for your daily use - that is, it allows you to create your very own podcast archive. Let‚Äôs see how you can do that in three simple steps.

## Step no. 1: switch off those updates

   loc="/assets/images/blog/2023"
   file="step-1.png"
   max-width="22rem"
   class="float-md-right ml-md-3 w-100"
%}

As you don‚Äôt expect new episodes to be published anymore for this podcast, you can safely disable its ‚Äú[Keep updated](https://antennapod.org/documentation/automation/refreshing-podcasts)‚Äù setting. That way, AntennaPod will refresh your subscriptions faster, as it will only do so for active ones.

If you aren‚Äôt sure whether new episodes will be published, you can still refresh this podcast manually (by swiping down on that podcast‚Äôs screen or by using the refresh icon on the same screen), or toggle back the ‚ÄúKeep updated‚Äù setting at any time.

## Step no. 2: assign a tag

From that same Podcast settings screen, or from your Subscriptions screen, edit the [tags](https://antennapod.org/documentation/subscriptions/subscription-groups) for this podcast, adding one named ‚ÄúArchive‚Äù.

## Step no. 3: off to the archive you go!

As a final step, deselect the ‚ÄúShow in main list‚Äù checkbox on the Tags dialog to hide this podcast from the list that is displayed on your Subscriptions screen.

   max-width="22rem"
   class="float-md-right ml-md-3 w-100"
%}

## Wait, does that mean‚Ä¶

Yes, you got it! You can create one large archive or even several ones divided by topic, publisher, language, frequency‚Ä¶ you name it! You can also assign multiple tags to the same podcast. And of course, you can use tags just as well to organise your active subscriptions, not just your archive.

Keeping old subscriptions also has an additional benefit: it ensures that your listening statistics remain accurate, as removed subscriptions are not counted, at least for now.

## What if I wanted to unarchive a podcast?

Your favourite podcast is back in action? To unarchive it, just edit its tags and (re)select the ‚ÄúShow in main list‚Äù checkbox. If you haven‚Äôt already, you may also need to toggle back its ‚ÄúKeep updated‚Äù setting to follow your global settings.
