To ensure the sustainability of an open podcasting ecosystem, podcasters need funding beyond advertising and buy-outs by platforms. AntennaPod supports different ways through which podcasters can earn an income:

* Somos compatibles con la etiqueta de [financiación](https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace/tags/funding), permitiendo que los podcasters añadan enlaces a sus páginas de pago en sus feeds RSS: ver [cómo usar esta etiqueta](https://podcasting2.org/docs/guides/how-to-use-the-funding-tag). Esta es la manera por defecto para que los podcasters obtengan apoyo financiero por parte de su audiencia.
* If for any reason you don't use the funding tag yet, you can still include information about how your audience can support you in your podcast or episode descriptions. It will still be visible to AntennaPod users, even though less prominently. For example, if you offer a premium tier, AntennaPod users will be able to subscribe to it using a personalized feed URL or by entering the login credentials you give them.
* In the future, we would also like to support automatic micropayments via the [value](https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace/tags/value) tag. As it is complex functionality and the technical specifications are still evolving, AntennaPod won't support it soon, but we are closely following developments.
