AntennaPod will not ask you for any general permissions. However you can give the following permissions:

* **Show notifications**: Via `Settings` » `Notifications` you can give AntennaPod the permission to create notifications.
* **Storage access**: When you add a 'local folder' the app will ask for long-term access to a specific folder. When you import a database or an OPML file, selecting that file will give the app one-time access to it.

Apart from that, the app requires the following permissions which are automatically granted by Android:

- **Full network access**: to refresh podcasts, download and stream episodes, load images and enable synchronization
- **View network connections** and **View Wi-Fi connections**:
   - to check if there is an active internet connection, before and while taking any of the above-mentioned actions
   - for the setting `Downloads` » `Mobile updates`, to determine whether the above actions are allowed by the user on the current (mobile and/or metered) connection
- **Pair with Bluetooth devices**: for the setting `Playback` » `Headphones or Bluetooth disconnect`, to automatically pause or play when the phone connects with or disconnects from a Bluetooth device
- **Run at startup**: to (re)start services like refreshing podcasts and enabling auto-downloads
- **Control vibration**: for the option `Vibrate shortly before end` of the sleep timer, to vibrate if this setting is enabled
- **Prevent device from sleeping**: needed to ensure media playback and downloads continue in the background
