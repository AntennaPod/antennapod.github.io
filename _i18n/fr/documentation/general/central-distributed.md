Il existe essentiellement deux façons de créer une application de podcast :

1. **Central** : Il y a un serveur central (géré par la société qui développe
l'application) qui vérifie les nouveaux épisodes et vous les propose ensuite.
1. **Distribué** : L'application elle-même vérifie les nouveaux épisodes,
directement auprès des éditeurs de podcasts.

AntennaPod utilise la méthode 2, c'est-à-dire que nous n'avons pas de serveur
central. Il y a quelques avantages et inconvénients à cette méthode.

- As the app checks for new episodes, the app creators (like us) don't have to
maintain a central server. This saves a lot of time and effort. It also saves a
lot of money, which means we don't need to rely on ads or large sums of
donations.
- As the app doesn't rely on a central server to collect new episodes,
AntennaPod will continue to work independently from what we do on our end. Using
the central method, if the company shuts down their server for whatever reason,
the app will stop to work.
- We, as app developers, don't and cannot know which podcasts you are subscribed
to, which episodes you might listen to, or even at what time you do. Publishers
of apps with a central server do collect such data, to the detriment of your
privacy.
- Some publishers offer private feeds, providing early access, special content
or ad-free episodes. Such feeds require a username and password, which
AntennaPod gives directly to the podcast host when requested. Centralised
services often simply don't allow adding private feeds. And if they do, it might
require sending your credentials to the app makers.
- Not having a central point of access, which would allow app developers to
remove podcasts from their server, there is no risk of censorship.
- On the other hand, a distributed model means that you will only get new
episodes when you refresh a podcast. In AntennaPod this is by default every 12
hours, but you can change this to more or less often and you can always manually
check for new episodes too. A central server can check for new episodes very
frequently or even be informed by podcast hosts in realtime. That way apps can
also know about new episodes much faster, without having to regularly check all
podcasts you are subscribed to.
- Also it isn't possible for AntennaPod to serve you any episodes that were
removed by the podcast publisher, for example because they only keep the 10 most
recent ones online. Apps that rely on a central server could be served with the
older episodes even if they have disappeared from the RSS feed.
