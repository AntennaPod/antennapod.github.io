To help organize your subscriptions you can assign tags (sometimes called groups or categories) to a podcast. Please note that for the moment it is not possible to create queues based on tags. This would require support for multiple queues first. (See also the [feature request](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/2648) on our development platform.)

To assign tags to a podcast you have to:

- Open a specific podcast
- Tap on the `gear` icon to access its settings
- Select the `Tags` setting
