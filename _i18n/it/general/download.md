Le versioni ufficiali di AntennaPod sono disponibili su Google Play e F-Droid:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod" target="_blank">{{- img-GP | strip -}}</a> <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod" target="_blank">{{- img-FD | strip -}}</a>

AntennaPod is only officially published in above two app stores because we don't have the time to support more. All other stores listing AntennaPod copied the app without our explicit permission. We are not responsible for updating those or making sure they work correctly. The F-Droid repository is not maintained by us, but by the people behind F-Droid. F-Droid usually takes a few days until updates get available ([read more](/documentation/general/f-droid)). If an update is still not available more than a week after its release, feel free to let us know by creating a post on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/)), and we'll investigate it.
