By default, all podcasts are refreshed with a 12-hour interval to pick up new episodes. Via `Settings` » `Network` » `Refresh podcasts` you can change the interval period or turn off the automatic updates.

You can also turn off this process for individual podcasts in case keeping a podcast up to date is unnecessary. You can use this, for example, if a podcast no longer releases new episodes. Alternatively, there might be a podcast of which you only want to listen to an episode occasionally. You can set this by going to a podcast, tapping on the `Gear` icon and changing the `Keep Updated` setting.

When you turn off this podcast setting, the podcast will no longer be updated when podcasts get refreshed automatically, or when you initiate this process from the `Queue` or the `Episodes` screen. You can still refresh that podcast, which will bring new episodes to AntennaPod.
