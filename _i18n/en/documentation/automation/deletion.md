Why are some downloaded episodes deleted?

AntennaPod has several mechanisms to make sure downloaded podcasts will not fill up your phone's memory. If you notice some downloaded episodes being deleted, have a look at these two settings:

## Delete after playing
Delete after playing is located in `Settings` » `Downloads` » `Automatic deletion`. When enabled, episodes are deleted when playback completes (but not when manually marking an episode as 'played').

## Delete before auto download
Delete before auto download is located in `Settings` » `Downloads` » `Automatic deletion`. If Automatic download needs space for new episodes, it will delete old episodes that are not in the queue and not marked as favorite. You can set which episodes are eligible for deletion based on their status (e.g. not favorited or not in queue) or a period of time after finishing.
