Why are some downloaded episodes deleted?

AntennaPod has several mechanisms to make sure downloaded podcasts will not fill up your phone's memory. If you notice some downloaded episodes being deleted, have a look at these two settings:

## Auto Delete
Auto Delete is located in `Settings` » `Storage`. When enabled, episodes are deleted when playback completes (but not when manually marking an episode as 'played').

## Episode Cleanup
Episode Cleanup is located in `Settings` » `Network` » `Automatic Download`. If Automatic Download needs space for new episodes, it will delete old episodes that are not in the queue and not marked as favorite. You can add a delay (x time after playback) or Episode. The setting `Episode Cache` determines the maximum amount of downloaded episodes.
