Currently there is no way to add an episode to the queue without subscribing. You can find more information in the [feature request on our development platform](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/4710).

There  is, however, a way to **preview** an episode without having to subscribe to the podcast. There are some downsides of this workaround:
- The episode automatically starts streaming (any previously playing or played episode is stopped)
- It's not possible to switch to another episode and come back to the previewed episode later

To preview an episode: 
- Do as if you were adding a subscription
- Don't tap on subscribe but on the episode you want to listen
- The episode description will expand; tap on `Preview` below description
