If you are a podcast producer and want to make your podcast visible in AntennaPod, this page is for you.

AntennaPod mainly uses two directories for its search feature:
* [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) (ask your hoster how to add your podcast, or add your own podcast via the [API](https://podcastindex-org.github.io/docs-api/#get-/add/byfeedurl))
* [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com) (add via [Podcast Connect](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/))

If your podcast is available in either of them, it can be found in AntennaPod.
