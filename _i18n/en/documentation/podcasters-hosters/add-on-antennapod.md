Do you want to make it easy for your network or audience to add your podcast(s) in AntennaPod?

Simply include a link to `https://antennapod.org/deeplink/subscribe?url=xyz` on your website or wherever you want. Make sure to replace `xyz` with the URL of your RSS feed. Users who have installed AntennaPod and open that link will be able to preview episodes and subscribe to your podcast directly in our app.

If you need our logo, please have a look at our [branding repository](https://github.com/AntennaPod/branding).
