To ensure the sustainability of an open podcasting ecosystem, podcasters need funding beyond advertising and buy-outs by platforms. AntennaPod supports different ways through which podcasters can earn an income:

* We support the [funding](https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace/tags/funding) tag, allowing podcasters to add links to their payment pages in their RSS feeds: see [https://podcasting2.org/docs/guides/how-to-use-the-funding-tag](how to use this tag). This is the standard way for podcasters to get financial support from their users.

* If a podcaster does not use the funding tag, but still includes in their RSS feed information about how to support them (e.g. via a premium tier), it will still be visible to AntennaPod users, even though less prominently.

* In the future, we would also like to support micropayments via the `value` tag. If you are a developer and would like to help out with that feature, please reach out on the [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/t/the-podcast-namespace-value-tag-in-antennapod/1084).

If you are a user and your favorite podcaster does not yet take advantage of the `funding` tag, please consider reaching out to them and encouraging them to do so by linking to this page!
