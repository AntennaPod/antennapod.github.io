To ensure the sustainability of an open podcasting ecosystem, podcasters need funding beyond advertising and buy-outs by platforms. AntennaPod supports different ways through which podcasters can earn an income:

* We support the [funding](https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace/tags/funding) tag, allowing podcasters to add links to their payment pages in their RSS feeds: see [how to use this tag](https://podcasting2.org/docs/guides/how-to-use-the-funding-tag). This is the standard way for podcasters to get financial support from their audience.

* If for any reason you don't use the funding tag yet, you can still include information about how your audience can support you in your podcast or episode descriptions. It will still be visible to AntennaPod users, even though less prominently. For example, if you offer a premium tier, AntennaPod users will be able to subscribe to it using a personalized feed URL or by entering the login credentials you give them.

* In the future, we would also like to support automatic micropayments via the [value](https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace/tags/value) tag. As it is complex functionality and the technical specifications are still evolving, AntennaPod won't support it soon, but we are closely following developments.
