AntennaPod is a [decentralized podcast app](/documentation/general/central-distributed). This basically means that there is no central server that knows everything about each podcast.

Media files are therefore taken directly from the publisher's website. If the publisher deletes these, AntennaPod can no longer retrieve it for you.
