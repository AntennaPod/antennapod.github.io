Do you get a notification saying that downloads completed with errors? Then AntennaPod could not retrieve the feed with episode information or an audio file from the website of the podcast hoster.

Issues that only occur with one or a few specific podcasts are often related to those podcasts. To confirm if this is the case, you can follow these steps:
1. tap on the notification to open the Download Log
2. tap on the specific notification with the error
3. long-press on the URL that is displayed, and copy it or open it in your web browser

If the URL doesn't work in the browser either, this means that it is definitely not a problem with AntennaPod. If you get the error message consistently then the podcast has likely been moved, taken off-line or not properly configured. Try contacting the podcast creators about it, as this is not something we could change on AntennaPod's end.

Does the error message in the Download log say 'Failed to connect to [url]'? Then this means that something is interfering with your network. If you have an ad-blocker, VPN, captive portal, proxy, privacy guard, special DNS service, or parental control set up on your phone, you can try turning these off.

If you can't pinpoint the issue, please share a screenshot of the error together with the podcast URL (RSS feed) [on our forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/c/support/7). Our community will happily have a look to find out the exact cause!
