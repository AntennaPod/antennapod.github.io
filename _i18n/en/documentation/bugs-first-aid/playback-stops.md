If playback always stops for example a few seconds after turning off the screen, or when you haven't opened AntennaPod for a while, your system might be killing the app. Some vendors are known to be overly aggressive when trying to save battery. **Please try to add an exception for AntennaPod in the list of battery optimized apps.** As the way to add an exception often differs between phones, we suggest searching on the web for instructions for your phone brand and model, if you don't know how to add an exception.

If this didn't help, don't hesitate to reach out to the AntennaPod contributors in our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org).
