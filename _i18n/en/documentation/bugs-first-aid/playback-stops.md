If playback always stops for example a few seconds after turning off the screen, or when you haven't opened AntennaPod for a while, your system might be killing the app. Some vendors are known to be overly aggressive when trying to save battery. **Please try to add an exception for AntennaPod in the list of battery optimized apps.**

Playback problems may also occur when listening to episodes in the MP4 format. AntennaPod uses Android's built-in audio decoders. A lot of devices are shipped with rather buggy MP4 decoders which may lead to various playback issues and even system crashes. **We recommend subscribing to MP3 feeds whenever possible.**

If this didn't help, don't hesitate to reach out to the AntennaPod contributors in our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org).
