AntennaPod is a decentralized podcast app ([more information](/documentation/general/central-distributed)). This basically means that there is no central server that knows everything about each podcast. Episodes are loaded directly from the publisher's website. If the publisher deletes an episode from their website, AntennaPod can no longer access it.
