Did you find a spelling mistake, or something that sounds odd? It's always possible that we made a mistake in English (in which we make the app & website), or that something has not been translated correctly. Luckily these issues are often easily fixed.

# Do you want to fix it yourself?
If the issue is in any other language than English, you can update **app translations** on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/antennapod/antennapod/core-values/). Issue with the **website translations** can be fixed on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/antennapod/). You can [find more information in our Contribute section](/contribute/translate).

Is the issue with the **English texts**? Then you will need to be or get familiar with GitHub. You can send a Pull Request for [the app](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/) or for [the website](https://github.com/AntennaPod/antennapod.github.io).

# Do you just want to inform us?
You can create a post in the [translations section on our forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/c/translations/11). To do so you need to create an account (if you don't have one already) or simply log in via Google.
