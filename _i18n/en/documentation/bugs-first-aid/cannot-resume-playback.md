In Android 13 and Android 14 it is not always possible to resume playback from the lock screen or media notification. This occurs specifically if playback has been paused for a while.

It currently is not clear why this issue occurs. We have established the same problem affects other apps, including Google's apps. We suspect, therefore, that this is an issue with Android.

## Workaround

In order to still be able to resume playback, you can add the so-called AntennaPod 'tile' on your device. Tiles are essentially the buttons that you see when you pull down from the top of the screen. You probably know the *Internet* or *Flashlight* tile. The AntennaPod tile allows you play and pause playback, even if playback has been paused for a while.

To add the AntennaPod tile:
1. **Pull down twice** from the top of the screen to fully open the Quick Settings. On some Android versions (for example, Samsung One UI or Xiaomi MIUI) an equivalent Control Center with similar gestures may already contain a media tile, check your device settings if behavior differs
2. **Tap on the pencil icon** at the tiles section to edit the tiles
3. Scroll through the list of tiles and **drag the AntennaPod tile** up into the list of active tiles
4. Tap the **back arrow** or **save** to exit the tile editing
