In Android 13 and Android 14 it is not always possible to resume playback from the lock screen or media notification. This occurs specifically if playback has been paused for a while.

It currently is not clear why this issue occurs. We have established the same problem affects other apps, including Google's apps. We suspect, therefore, that this is an issue with Android.

## Workaround

In order to still be able to resume playback, you can add the so-called AntennaPod 'tile' on your device. Tiles are essentially the buttons that you see when you pull down from the top of the screen. You probably know the Internet or Flashlight tile. The AntennaPod tile allows you play and pause playback, even if playback has been paused for a while.

To add the AntennaPod tile:
1. **Pull down twice** from the top of the screen to fully open the Quick Settings (some Android versions may have an equivalent Control Center which can be displayed with similar gestures, such as **pulling down once** from the *top right* of the screen).
2. **Tap on the pencil icon** at the bottom of the tiles section to edit the tiles
3. Scroll down the list of tiles, **tap on the AntennaPod tile and drag it** up into the list of active tiles
4. Tap the back arrow to exit the tile editing
