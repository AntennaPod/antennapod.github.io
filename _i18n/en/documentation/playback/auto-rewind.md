When an episode has been paused and is played again, AntennaPod will automatically rewind, so it is easier to continue following the show. How much is rewound is not configurable and depends on how long an episode has been paused.

| Time since last playback | Rewind duration |
| --- | --- |
| More than 1 day | 20 seconds |
| More than 1 hour | 10 seconds |
| More than 1 minute | 3 seconds |
