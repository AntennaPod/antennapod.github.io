Smart shuffle is an advanced queue sorting criterion that allows you to keep your queue sorted by publication date while also alternating between episodes from different subscriptions. It is useful if you wish to avoid having clusters of consecutive episodes from a single subscription in your queue. For more details on how the smart shuffle algorithm works, see [this PR](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/6030).

To use smart shuffle, place some episodes from different subscriptions in your queue, then tap `â€¦` in the top bar, select `Sort` and finally `Smart shuffle`.
Just like other sorting criteria, smart shuffle can be sorted in ascending or descending order.
