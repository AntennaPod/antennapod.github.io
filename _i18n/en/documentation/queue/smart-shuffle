Smart shuffle is an advanced queue sorting criterion that allows you to keep your queue sorted by publication date while also alternating between episodes from different subscriptions in a round-robin fashion. It is useful if you wish to avoid having clusters of consecutive episodes from a single subscription in your queue.

To use smart shuffle, place some episodes from different subscriptions in your queue, then tap `â€¦` in the top bar, select `Sort` and finally `Smart shuffle`.
Just like other sorting criteria, smart shuffle can be sorted in ascending or descending order.
