You can set AntennaPod to download episodes to your sd card instead of the internal memory. This ensures that you have more space for episodes. To select the storage card, go to `Settings` » `Storage` » `Data folder`.

## Troubleshooting

It might be possible that your SD card does not show up in the `Choose Data Folder` dialog. For your SD card to show up, Android must recognize the card as external storage. Either the card is not mounted correctly or the manufacturer or your smartphone configured the hardware incorrectly.
