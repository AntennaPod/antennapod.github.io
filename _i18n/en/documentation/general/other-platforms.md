However attractive the title may sound, AntennaPod is not and will not be available on Windows, iOS or the Linux desktop. The app is made by a small team of volunteers, and making the app for these other platforms would be a lot of work.

There are (open source) alternatives, however, which we would like to point you to:
App/Application|Windows|iOS|Linux
---|---|---|---
[Kasts](https://apps.kde.org/kasts/)|No|No|Yes
[Vocal](https://vocalproject.net/)|No|No|Yes
[gPodder](https://gpodder.github.io/)|Yes|Yes|Yes
[Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/)|No|Yes|No
[Podverse](https://podverse.fm/about)|No|Yes|No

Do you have a recommendation of an open source podcast app for these platforms? [Let us know on the forum!](https://forum.antennapod.org)
