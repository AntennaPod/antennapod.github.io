The official versions of AntennaPod are completely ad-free and open source! If you are seeing ads, this can have two reasons:

- **The podcast publishers added the ads to their shownotes or audio file.** AntennaPod plays podcasts just like they were published by the creators. If they include ads, AntennaPod plays them. We have nothing to do with those ads, so the revenue fully goes to the publishers of your podcast.
- **You downloaded an unofficial version of AntennaPod.** AntennaPod is open-source. This means that anyone can download the source code. Unfortunately, some developers take AntennaPod, insert ads and then publish it as a new app. You can get the official AntennaPod app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/). You can even get the latest release on [GitHub](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/) and build AntennaPod yourself!
