The official versions of AntennaPod are completely ad-free and open source! If you are seeing or hearing ads, this can have two reasons:

- **The podcast creator or the company hosting the podcast included ads in the shownotes, chapter art or audio files.** AntennaPod gets episodes as they are published. If they include ads, AntennaPod plays or displays them. Some hosting companies have 'automatic ad insertion', which make ads sound injected in an unnatural way. The revenues fully go to the creators and/or the hosting company of your podcast.
- **You downloaded an unofficial version of AntennaPod.** AntennaPod is open-source. This means that anyone can download the source code. Unfortunately, some developers take AntennaPod, insert ads and then publish it as a new app. You can get the official AntennaPod app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/). You can even get the latest release on [GitHub](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/) and build AntennaPod yourself!

We are fully volunteer- and donation-driven. [Check here how you can contribute!](/contribute)
