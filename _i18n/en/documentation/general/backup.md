There are a few options to copy your data to your new phone, and each method copies a certain amount of data:

## Database Export
Exporting the AntennaPod database is a great method if you're migrating to a new phone or tablet. You should make sure you have the same version of AntennaPod on both the old and new phone. After importing all data is restored; you will only need to re-download episodes.

## Synchronization
Synchronizing AntennaPod via *gpodder.net* or the *gPodder Sync* app for Nextcloud allows to save and migrate some podcast & episode data. You will lose your favorites, queue, and app settings. This may be a solution when switching between phone, tablet and/or desktop. Please see the [article on synchronization](/documentation/general/synchronization) for instructions.

## OPML
OPML files allow to transfer your subscriptions to another podcast app. You will lose any podcast- or episode-specific data (e.g. which episodes have been played) and all app settings. To export your file, go to `Settings` » `Storage` »  `Import/Export`. Be sure to click `Send…` to save the file in another folder on your phone or somewhere else, because the original file will be deleted when you uninstall AntennaPod.

If you import the file in AntennaPod on another device, the app will display a list of podcasts with checkboxes. The podcasts you select from that list will be added to your existing subscriptions. None of your existing subscriptions will be affected.
