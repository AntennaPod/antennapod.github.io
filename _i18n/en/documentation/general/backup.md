There are a few options to copy your data to your new phone, and each method copies a certain amount of data:

## Database Export
Exporting the AntennaPod database is a great method if you're migrating to a new phone or tablet. You should make sure you have the same version of AntennaPod on both the old and new phone. After importing all data is restored; you will only need to re-download episodes.

## Synchronization
Synchronizing AntennaPod via *gpodder.net* or the *gPodder Sync* app for Nextcloud allows to save and migrate some podcast & episode data. You will lose your favorites, queue, and app settings. This may be a solution when switching between phone, tablet and/or desktop. Please see the [article on synchronization](/documentation/general/synchronization) for instructions.

## OPML
OPML files allow you to transfer your subscriptions to another podcast app. You will lose any podcast-specific - or episode-specific data (e.g., which episodes have been played) and all app settings. To export your file, go to `Settings` » `Import/Export` » `OPML export`. Depending on your Android version, you may be asked to choose where to save the file. If a *save dialog* opens right away, make sure to select a folder outside the AntennaPod directory (for example, `Downloads` or another visible folder), so the exported OPML file is not deleted if you uninstall AntennaPod.

If you import the file in AntennaPod on another device, the app will display a list of podcasts with checkboxes. The podcasts you select from that list will be added to your existing subscriptions. None of your existing subscriptions will be affected.
