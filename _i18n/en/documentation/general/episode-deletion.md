When you are done listening with an episode, in most cases you want to delete it from your phone, to free up space. There is different ways that you can do that.

Firstly, you can of course manually delete episodes. When viewing the queue or a specific podcast, you can long-press an episode and tap `Delete`. When viewing the Completed tab in the Downloads screen you can also simply tap the bin icon. If you want, AntennaPod can automatically remove en episode from the queue if it is deleted. You can find this option under `Settings` » `Storage` »  `Delete removes from Queue`.

Secondly, AntennaPod has some solutions to automatically delete episodes. Particularly, AntennaPod can automatically delete episodes when playback completes, and when it needs space for the Automatic Download process. For more information on these options, please see the [Automatic Deletion](/documentation/automation/deletion) article.
