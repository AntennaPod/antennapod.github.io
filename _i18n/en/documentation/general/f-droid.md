After every new release of AntennaPod, we get asked when it will be available on F-Droid. Releases on F-Droid take a few days, so please be patient.

- After we create a [release](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/releases), F-Droid first needs to detect that something in AntennaPod changed. For this, F-Droid runs an update checker server about every 1-2 days.
- After F-Droid detects that there is a new AntennaPod release, it builds the app. With this, F-Droid makes sure that the app you download really matches the source code that AntennaPod publishes. Because there are many apps to build, the F-Droid server takes about an additional 1-2 days to build the app.
- Finally, the resulting app needs to get signed cryptographically. This happens on a computer that is not connected to the internet. A person at F-Droid needs to take the app, and physically walk it to that special computer. How long this takes depends on how often the person walks to that special computer. Usually, this step takes an additional 1-2 days after the app was built.

You can check the progress of the release using the [F-Droid Monitor](https://monitor.f-droid.org/builds).
As you can see, it can easily take a week before a new AntennaPod release is available on F-Droid.
If an update is still not available more than a week after its release, feel free to let us know by creating a post on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/)), and we'll investigate it.
