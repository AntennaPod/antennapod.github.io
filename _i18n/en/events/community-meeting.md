Every month we meet to discuss anything related to AntennaPod. From feature and enhancement suggestions by contributors, via usability questions and donation expense proposals, to branding updates.

Weâ€™ll discuss and announce the next topics, and report back on what we discussed on the forum. Do you want to receive a notification every now and then about the community calls? Then join the ['community callers' group on the forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/g/community-callers). The group will be tagged before & after the meetings, so you'll get a ping at each relevant update.

Always want to have the latest communinity call dates and times in your calendar - even when changes are made? Then add the AntennaPod calendar in your favourite app via the 'Add to calendar' link!
