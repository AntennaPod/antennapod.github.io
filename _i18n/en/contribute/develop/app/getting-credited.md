To be credited on the Contributors page on GitHub and in the app, your commits must be linked to your GitHub account. Simply create the commits with an email address that is linked to your GitHub account (or add that email address to GitHub). You can verify if it worked by checking whether the icon below the commit shows your profile picture.

To change the author of the most recent commit, you can run a command such as `git commit --amend --author="John Doe <john@doe.org>"`. Changing something that way requires to force-push the changes (`git push --force`). To change multiple commits, have a look at [interactive rebase](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history).

If you don't care about appearing on the Contributors page, please indicate this in your pull request.

After your work is merged, we also encourage you to talk about it and claim that fame! It might inspire other potential contributors, and helps promote the app generally. We're happy to retweet your tweets!
