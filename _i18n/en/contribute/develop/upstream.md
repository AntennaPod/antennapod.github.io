AntennaPod doesn't live in isolation. The project relies on many others - contributing to those means helping AntennaPod thrive:
* **Nextcloud GPodder Sync app** (PHP)
To synchronize your podcasts using your Nextcloud server, you can use the [GPodder Sync app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/gpoddersync).
You can contribute to its development [on GitHub](https://github.com/thrillfall/nextcloud-gpodder).
* **gpodder.net** (Python, HTML)
The long-standing and libre [gpodder.net](https://gpodder.net/) project allows users to connect and synchronize their podcast players. Unfortunately the project is a victim of its own success: the web server is sometimes overloaded. Any support to the project and its maintainers is welcome. The project is developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo).
