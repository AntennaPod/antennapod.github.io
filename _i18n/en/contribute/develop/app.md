You're right at it: the core of the project! Used by thousands of people across the world, your contributions are an important contribution to an open podcasting ecosystem. So, are you experienced with Java, or just getting started? We welcome your contributions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod).

## Where we need help
There's a few areas where we could well use your support. When first getting started to AntennaPod development, we recommend to pick an issue with the ['Good first issue' label](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/Good%20first%20issue) on GitHub. Before you start working on an issue, make sure that it does not have the 'Needs: Triage' or 'Needs: Decision' label. Those labels mean that the feature was not reviewed by the core AntennaPod team yet.

If you prefer bug-hunting, your go-to list for a weekend bug-hunt is the ['confirmed bugs' issue label](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/Type%3A%20Confirmed%20bug) on GitHub.

## Getting started
**Before** Please don't just submit a PR, but always *announce your interest first*. Sometimes we didn't yet reach an agreement on a user experience and interface. It can happen that someone agreed to start working on something, but we forgot to 'assign' the GitHub issue. Chipping in on our forum is the best way to avoid lost hours on code that won't be accepted.

**During** Have a look at our wiki; it contains [handy info for contributors](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki). You'll find there, for example, information about the project's [code style](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Code-style) and can learn [how to make sure you get accredited](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki/Getting-accredited-on-the-Contributors-page) for your work in the app. Last but not least: build instructions and info about debug logs.

**After** Talk about your work, and claim that fame! It might inspire other potential contributors, and helps promote the app generally. We're happy to retweet your tweets!
