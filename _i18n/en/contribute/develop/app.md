You're right at it: the core of the project! Used by thousands of people across the world, your contributions are an important contribution to an open podcasting ecosystem. So, are you experienced with Java, or just getting started? We welcome your contributions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod).

## Where we need help
There are a few areas where we could well use your support. When first getting started to AntennaPod development, we recommend to pick an issue with the ['Good first issue' label](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/Good%20first%20issue) on GitHub. Before you start working on an issue, make sure that it does not have the 'Needs: Triage' or 'Needs: Decision' label. Those labels mean that the feature was not reviewed by the core AntennaPod team yet.

If you prefer hunting bugs, your go-to list for a weekend bug-hunt is the ['confirmed bugs' issue label](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/Type%3A%20Confirmed%20bug) on GitHub.

## Getting started
Before submitting a pull request, always *announce your interest first*. Sometimes we haven't reached an agreement on a user experience and interface yet. Or it can happen that someone volunteered to start working on something, but we forgot to 'assign' the GitHub issue. Chipping in on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org) is the best way to avoid losing hours on code that won't be accepted.

To keep things tidy, we prefer to have broader discussions on features on our forum. Once a decision has been reached, a concrete and boiled down description of the desired solution will be added to the relevant issue. More technical discussions on how to implement that can then take place in pull requests.
