## Data the AntennaPod app itself (not third-party services) collects, stores and processes locally
Other than third-parties, only data strictly necessary for the app to function is recorded, and only on the device.
This includes podcasts you follow, the app settings, and login data provided for specific podcasts or services (such as syncing services).
The app itself (not third-party services) does not insert advertisement libraries, or third-party tracking (analytics).

**Except for third-party services, all data provided and created when using the AntennaPod app is stored locally on your device.
This means your data is not sent or uploaded anywhere, except when the you search, or turn on third-party services in the app.**
When interfacing with third-party services, the app itself receives subscriptions and playback events provided by the respective services.

## App data third-parties collect, store and process

- Discovery and search services: When opening the Discover screen in the app, it sends a call to Apple to collect podcast suggestions.
They may store the query, including country (which by default is the device's country).
These suggestions can be disabled by choosing "Off" in the region selector.
When using the search feature in AntennaPod, the services PodcastIndex.org, iTunes, fyyd, gpodder.net, mzstatic.com, and podnews.net, and omnycontent.com
may store your query, including the search terms.
Discovery and search queries also include the IP address, time, and the app name "AntennaPod".
After subscribing, the feed is served from the podcast hoster, meaning the discovery/search service is no longer involved.
- Syncing services: When turned on via the settings, AntennaPod syncs your data.
This data may include login credentials, subscribed podcasts, listened episodes, play, paused and favorite actions with date- and timestamps and your IP address.
Consult your provider's privacy policy (e.g. [gpodder.net's privacy policy](https://gpodder.net/privacy), or the one of your Nextcloud host).
- Podcast hosters: When provided in the podcast settings, a host receives the authentication data you provided.
Servers providing the podcast feeds might collect data in so doing, like your IP address, access time and content you download or stream.
Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.
You can view the URL of a podcast by opening the podcast and pressing the 'Info' icon.
AntennaPod does not allow any remote servers to set cookies.
The servers can detect the fact that you are using AntennaPod and which version of AntennaPod you are using (HTTP user-agent).
If multiple podcasts are hosted on the same server, the server can detect the list of podcasts hosted on that server you are subscribed to.
This might happen if publishers use FeedBurner, Podtrac or similar services to distribute their feeds.
- Backups: (If turned on in "Settings → System → Advanced" in the device settings) Android saves copies of device data on the server of your chosen provider.
This will contain private info, including your Wi-Fi passwords, messages and call history.
It also includes data from AntennaPod and from other apps you use.
AntennaPod developers do not have access to this data.
