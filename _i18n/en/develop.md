As a community project, AntennaPod relies on voluntary code contributions from a wide range of people. Not just for the app itself, but also the website and related projects.

# App
You're right at it: the core of the project! Used by thousands of people across the world, your contributions are an important contribution to an open podcasting ecosystem. So, are you experienced with Java, or just getting started? We welcome your contributions in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod).

## Where we need help
There's a few areas where we could well use your support. Because they're important, often-requested, or both. Get yourself into any of the following issues and we'll add you to our (mental) list for eternal gratitude:
* [Re-implementation of Chromecast support](https://forum.antennapod.org/t/developers-wanted-google-chromecast-support/657) (otherwise in May 2022 we'll unfortunately have to depricate it)
* [Improvements to and new features for tagging podcasts](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1711) (issue closed, but many valuable requests & ideas can be found there still), including [user-definable queues](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/2648)
* [Option to download oldest episodes first](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1077) and other issues around [automatic deletion](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/milestone/47)
* [Podcasting 2.0 and Podcast Index integration](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/Podcast%20Index%20%2F%20Podcasting%202.0)

Please don't just submit a PR, but always announce your interest first. Sometimes we didn't yet reach an agreement on a user experience and interface. It can happen that someone agreed to start working on something, but we forgot to 'assign' the GitHub issue. Chipping in on our forum is the best way to avoid lost hours on code that won't be accepted.

Apart from these major projects, you can always check out the issues with the ['help wanted' label](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/help%20wanted) on GitHub.

## Bug fixing
Users often chip in on GitHub and our forum with possible bugs. Your go-to-list for a weekend bug-hunt is the ['confirmed bugs' issue label](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/labels/confirmed%20bug) on GitHub.

## Getting started
To read up on how we develop the app, please have a look at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/wiki). There you'll find information about code style, build instructions and debug logs.

# Website
The base of our new website was kindly built by [Anxhelo](https://lushka.al). Now we're ready to expand! Are you familiar with [Jakyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? Then help us implement (parts of) [our website wishlist](https://forum.antennapod.org/t/sitemap-for-the-new-website/240) and check out our [website repository](https://github.com/AntennaPod/antennapod.github.io) now.

# Get in touch
Vaguely interested but not sure yet? Ready to get started? Get in touch with @Keunes or @ByteHamster on [our forum](https://forum.antennapod.org)!

# Upstream & other projects
AntennaPod doesn't live in isolation. The project relies on many others - contributing to those means helping AntennaPod thrive:
* **Nextcloud Podcast app** (Vue, PHP, Javascript)
December 2020 Jonas Heinrich created the [Nextcloud Podcast app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/podcast). It already is a great way to subscribe and listen to your podcasts online, in a self-hosted environment. It's further development and [integration with AntennaPod](https://git.project-insanity.org/onny/nextcloud-app-podcast/-/issues/103) would be a very welcome addition.
* **gpodder.net** (Python, HTML)
The long-standing and libre [gpodder.net](https://gpodder.net/) project allows users to connect and synchronise their podcast players. Unfortunately the project is a victim of its own success: the webserver often being unavailable and AntennaPod-users see sync errors. Any support to the project and its maintainers is welcome, in particular with [this API issue](https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo/issues/128).
