SUMMARY:Needs: Decision - AntennaPod UX discussions
DESCRIPTION:We are very careful about AntennaPodâ€™s User Experience (UX)
 . The projectâ€™s goal here is to balance simplicity with feature-richness.
  Sometimes that requires some hard thinking on how to implement a feature
  request.\n\nWhere do we place this button? What would most users expect 
 AntennaPod to do here? Which impact does this choice have on other settin
 gs? How can we implement this without making the UI or code complex?\n\nI
 n these meetings @ByteHamster and @Keunes get together to do just that\: 
 discuss the options for a given feature request\, and try to reach a deci
 sion. One issue at a time. Youâ€™re most welcome to listen in as a fly on t
 he wall\, or jump in and share your thoughts.\n\n

SUMMARY:10 Year anniversary ðŸŽ‰
DESCRIPTION:AntennaPodâ€™s very first release was on 2012-07-22. This is 
 also when the app was first uploaded to Google Play. AntennaPod is turnin
 g a decade old!\n\nWe would like to honor the event by inviting past\, cu
 rrent and future users to celebrate.\n\nThe agenda includes looking back 
 at how the App has evolved throughout the releases. This could also be a 
 great opportunity for socializing with the core team\, occasional contrib
 utors as well as with normal users.\n\n
