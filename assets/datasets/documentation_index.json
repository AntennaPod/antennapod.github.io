I lost my podcasts/episodes/settings/everything!The problem is that the database with all information (episodes, listening states, etc) has some mistakes. AntennaPod cannot function with the broken database and had to start over with an empty one. While it’s been happening less frequently in recent versions of AntennaPod, it still is occurring for some users. Our community of developers have not been able to pinpoint what exactly causes a database to break. The same issue occurs also in some other open source apps. But we realise it is very frustrating when this happens and are really sorry if you were affected too.There may be some things you can do to recover your data. We list them below, starting with the solution that gives the easiest &amp; best results:  Have you recently exported a backup from AntennaPod recently? Then restoring that is relatively easily: go to Settings » Storage » Import/Export » Database import and select the back-up.  If you don’t have a back-up, the next step is to attempt to recover the broken database (‘repair corrupted sql database’). If AntennaPod detects a broken database, it writes it to a file CorruptedDatabaseBackup.db in the app storage directory. It is a challenge and it requires some skills or learning. You will have to use a terminal.          One community member followed these steps to repair the database and indicated that after this they could successfully import the repaired database.      Another community member took a clean database and moved content from the corrupted one in it, and then performed another correction. After both steps, they managed to successfully imported the new database in AntennaPod.        While all the data about your subscriptions and episodes are gone, the media files will still be there.          In AntennaPod you can add a folder as if it were a feed. To do this, go to Add Podcast and tap on Add local folder. Then go to this folder on your phone: Android » data » de.danoeh.antennapod » files » media and then the select the folder of a podcast. Note that this will only give you access to previously downloaded media - you will not receive new episodes.      You can also start adding previous podcasts from scratch. You can look through the folder mentioned above to see which podcasts you were subscribed to.      "

The app is developed by volunteers without commercial interest and the project relies on donations to cover costs. As AntennaPod’s source code and income and expenses are public everyone is free to verify this.If you are seeing ads, this can have two reasons:1. You downloaded an unofficial version of AntennaPodAntennaPod is open-source. This means that anyone can download the source code. Unfortunately, some developers take AntennaPod, insert ads and then publish it as a new app. You can get the official AntennaPod app on Google Play and F-Droid. You can even get the latest release from GitHub and build AntennaPod yourself!2. The podcast publishers added the ads to their shownotes or audio fileAntennaPod plays podcasts just like they were published by the creators. If they include ads, AntennaPod plays them. We have nothing to do with those ads, so the revenue fully goes to the publishers of your podcast.Now, you might ask something like “But then why is the podcast in English and the ad in German?” or “But why is the podcast episode from 2008 but still promotes a product released in 2023?”. The reason is a technique called dynamic ad insertion. Podcast publishers can instruct the hosting company to insert those ads. Then, while downloading or streaming the episode with AntennaPod, the media file delivered to AntennaPod gets cut on-the-fly to include the ads. The ads are recent (while the episode might not be) and can be targeted based on the IP address from which you request the media file (e.g. a company in your country). Depending on how smart the hosting company does this, the ads might get inserted right in the middle of a sentence. Some of the hosting companies also mess up the chapter marks while inserting the ads (so the chapters are off by the duration of the ad).You can always use the fast forward button in AntennaPod to skip the ads. If you are streaming an episode instead of downloading, the hosting company has an idea of how far you are in the podcast. It might be possible that the company detects the fact that you skipped the ad and insert a new one. If you instead download the episode, they cannot do that and you can skip the ads more reliably. (Downloading is also better for your privacy because then the hosting company does not know when you listen to which section of the episode. AntennaPod can be configured to automatically download and later delete episodes, so you don’t have to do that manually.)Additionally, many podcast hosts provide an ad-free feed that you can buy. Usually, you then either get a secret podcast feed URL, or alternatively username and password that you can enter in AntennaPod.If you find these ads annoying, consider talking to the podcast publishers about this."

      "content"  : "Central and distributed podcast appsThere are basically two ways how to make a podcast app:  Central: There is a central server (run by the company that develops the app) that checks for new episodes and then delivers them to you.  Distributed: The app itself checks new episodes, directly from the podcast publishers.AntennaPod uses method 2. It has both its advantages and disadvantages:  As the app checks for new episodes, the app creators (like us) don’t have to maintain a central server. This saves a lot of time and effort. It also saves a lot of money, which means we don’t need to rely on ads or large sums of donations.  As the app doesn’t rely on a central server to collect new episodes, AntennaPod will continue to work independently from what we do on our end. Using the central method, if the company shuts down their server for whatever reason, the app will stop to work.  We, as app developers, don’t and cannot know which podcasts you are subscribed to, which episodes you might listen to, or even at what time you do. Publishers of apps with a central server do collect such data, to the detriment of your privacy.  Some publishers offer private feeds, providing early access, special content or ad-free episodes. Such feeds require a username and password, which AntennaPod gives directly to the podcast host when requested. Centralised services often simply don’t allow adding private feeds. And if they do, it might require sending your credentials to the app makers.  Not having a central point of access, which would allow app developers to remove podcasts from their server, there is no risk of censorship.  On the other hand, a distributed model means that you will only get new episodes when you refresh a podcast. In AntennaPod this is by default every 12 hours, but you can change this to more or less often and you can always manually check for new episodes too. A central server can check for new episodes very frequently or even be informed by podcast hosts in realtime. That way apps can also know about new episodes much faster, without having to regularly check all podcasts you are subscribed to.  Also it isn’t possible for AntennaPod to serve you any episodes that were removed by the podcast publisher, for example because they only keep the 10 most recent ones online. Apps that rely on a central server could be served with the older episodes even if they have disappeared from the RSS feed."

For this, F-Droid runs an update checker server about every 2 days.  After F-Droid detects that there is a new AntennaPod release, it builds the app. With this, F-Droid makes sure that the app you download really matches the source code that AntennaPod publishes. Because there are many apps to build, the F-Droid server takes an additional 1-2 days to build the app.  Finally, the resulting app needs to get signed cryptographically. This happens on a computer that is not connected to the internet. A person at F-Droid needs to take the app and physically walk it to that special computer. How long this takes depends on how often the person walks to that special computer. Usually, this step takes an additional 1-2 days after the app was built.As you can see it can easily take a week before a new AntennaPod release is available on F-Droid, so please be patient.

You can find more about that here. After subscribing, new episodes are shown on Episodes » New. There you can decide if you actually like to listen to them or not. New means that you have not yet decided what to do with the episode.  If you are not interested in an episode, just swipe it away and AntennaPod removes the new label. The episode still stays marked as unplayed and you can find it on the Episodes » All page, as well as on the podcast’s page.  If you are interested in the episode, you can do one of two things, depending on your listening behavior.          Download the episode. When downloading, AntennaPod also automatically adds the episode to the queue and removes the new label. There is a setting if you want new episodes to be enqueued in the back, front or after the currently playing episode. Downloading is the main way AntennaPod was originally designed to be used but as streaming is becoming more and more popular, you can also use the second option.      Just add the episode to the queue. AntennaPod automatically removes the new label and inserts it into the queue. You can later directly play the episode without having to download, so it does not take up space. Think: Streaming like videos on YouTube. The disadvantage is that it will not be available offline, uses up your mobile data connection when you are on the run, and makes fast forwarding a little bit slower.        If you are done playing, AntennaPod marks the episode as played and removes it from the queue. There is a setting to also automatically delete the download after playing. You can find a list of all episodes that are still downloaded to your device (whether they are in the queue or not) on the Downloads » Completed page.  If you like an episode and are thinking about listening to it again, you can also mark it as favorite. It will then appear on the Episodes » Favorites page and (by default) will not be deleted after playing.In case you are subscribed to a really great podcast where you know from the beginning that all episodes will be great, you can use the auto-download feature. When enabled for a podcast, all of its future new episodes are automatically downloaded and added to the queue. They will automatically be removed from the Episodes » New page as soon as they are downloaded."

      "content"  : "Subscribing to a podcastThe first thing you want to do after downloading a podcast app is to subscribe to a podcast.SubscribingOpen the drawer by swiping from the left or tapping the ☰ burger icon on the top left corner. Go to + Add Podcast. Now, you can search, browse suggestions or add a podcast with its RSS address.Alternatively, you can import an OPML file or only check the Apple Podcasts, gpodder.net, fyyd or Podcast Index database respectively. Importing RSS or Atom feeds, or URL schemes like pcast:// and itpc://, will also work.Subscribing to third-party servicesWe got some questions about support for platforms like SoundCloud, Mixcloud and alike. While it may be cool to have a feature to simply paste/open channel URLs in AntennaPod, it’s been decided to not implement it. Such platforms may come and disappear, while it’s quite some work for our volunteers to implement this feature. If you’re a developer, you’re of course welcome to discuss a proposal that you’d be happy to implement.SoundCloudSoundCloud allows producers to create podcasts from their content pretty easily. You should reach out to them, share the SoundCloud help page (linked just before), and ask if they’re willing to set it up.MixcloudMixcloud unfortunately doesn’t offer this option for content creators. As always, there’s someone in the podcasting community to come up with a solution. You should check out the options as laid out in this post.YouTubeYouTube allows you subscribe to a channel’s feed, but:  AntennaPod cannot automatically download the videos, as YouTube doesn’t allow that. Showing ads is their business model, after all.  You won’t have an image connected to your subscription, as YouTube doesn’t include it in the feeds.But it is a way to get notified about new episodes. Just add the URL of the user/channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/USERNAME or https://www.youtube.com/channel/CHANNEL_ID) in AntennaPod. You should be presented with an dialog with the option ‘RSS’; tap to add the feed. If that doesn’t work as described, add https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=&lt;CHANNEL_ID&gt; to AntennaPod. You can find the channel id in the URL of the channel. If the channel you want to subscribe to is a user account (with a URL like youtube.com/user/UserName), you can contact the user to ask for their channel id (here it’s explained how users can find their channel id).We don’t have any information on other platforms, as you can see. We’re happy to include it here if you share your thoughts via the forum."
