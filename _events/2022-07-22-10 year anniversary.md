AntennaPodâ€™s very first release was on 2012-07-22. This is also when the app was first uploaded to Google Play. AntennaPod is turning a decade old!

We would like to honor the event by inviting past, current and future users to celebrate.

The agenda includes looking back at how the App has evolved throughout the releases. This could also be a great opportunity for socializing with the core team, occasional contributors as well as with normal users.
